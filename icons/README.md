# Icon Placeholder Files

Since I cannot generate actual image files, you'll need to create icon files for your extension:

## Required Icons:

- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels) - Toolbar icon
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels) - Extension management page
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels) - Chrome Web Store

## Icon Design Suggestions:

- Use a clock or productivity-themed icon
- Include elements like ‚è∞, üí™, or üìà
- Use your brand colors
- Ensure icons are clear at small sizes

## How to Create Icons:

1. Use any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Canva, etc.)
2. Create square images at the required sizes
3. Save as PNG format with transparency
4. Place them in the `icons/` folder

## Temporary Solution:

You can use any PNG images with the correct names and sizes for testing. The extension will work without icons, but they'll appear as generic placeholder icons in Chrome.
